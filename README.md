# node-red_website
## Login and input the information in web application built on bluemix with node-red.

I have use the easiest way to create the Website Login and Register Page with Bootstrap. But my target is the users can input and output
their information into the database which included in bluemix. I amnot good at the web font end development. So I didn't use much css and JavaScript
to decorate the website. The difficult point is how to use the node-red to connect the clound database and I/O the data from the database.
I think the background language I will use the JavaScript. I will release after I finish.

The website you can check here : http://cograph123.mybluemix.net/login  (with the easiest way)
